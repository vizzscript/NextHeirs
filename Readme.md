## Blockchain System based on Inheritance Management

This project involves the creation of a blockchain system that handles the management of wills and inheritance. It aims to provide a secure and transparent platform for the distribution of assets according to a person's will.

The requirements for this project might include:

- Understanding of blockchain technology and Ethereum
- Familiarity with Solidity for smart contracts
- Ability to use IPFS for secure document storage
- Proficiency in React for user interface development
- Experience with Node.js and Express for server-side application development
- Knowledge of MongoDB for database management

The technology stack for this project will consist of:

- Blockchain Platform: Ethereum
- Smart Contract Language: Solidity
- Document Storage: InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)
- Frontend Development: React.js
- Backend Development: Node.js with Express.js
- Database: MongoDB

For a blockchain-based inheritance management system, defining clear, structured requirements is crucial to guide the development process and ensure the final product meets the intended goals. Below are the key requirements categorized by functional, non-functional, and technical aspects:

### Functional Requirements

1. User Account Management
   - Users can register, login, and manage their profiles.
   - Integration with blockchain wallets (e.g., MetaMask) for identity verification and transactions.

2. Will Creation and Management
   - Users can create, edit, and view their wills.
   - Support for specifying assets (digital and physical) and beneficiaries.
   - Mechanism for users to appoint executors or witnesses if required.

3. Smart Contract Execution
   - Automatic execution of wills upon verification of the testator's death.
   - Distribution of assets to the designated beneficiaries according to the will.
   - Support for conditional distributions and delayed inheritances.

4. Death Verification Process
   - Secure and verifiable process to confirm the testator's death.
   - Option for manual verification by appointed executors or automatic verification through integration with public records/databases.

5. Asset Registration and Management
   - Interface for users to list and describe assets to be included in their will.
   - Mechanism to handle digital assets directly on the blockchain and instructions for physical assets.

6. Notifications and Alerts
   - System to notify users of important events (e.g., will execution, status updates).

7. **Privacy and Access Control**
   - Ensure that wills and user information are kept private, with access control mechanisms in place to protect sensitive data.

### Non-functional Requirements

1. Security
   - High-level encryption for data storage and transmission.
   - Smart contracts must be audited for vulnerabilities.

2. Scalability
   - The system should efficiently handle a growing amount of user data and transactions without degradation in performance.

3. Reliability
   - High uptime, with mechanisms in place to handle failures or attacks without loss of data or service.

4. User Experience
   - Intuitive UI/UX for ease of use, especially for users unfamiliar with blockchain technology.
   - Responsive design to accommodate various devices.

5. Compliance
   - Adherence to legal and regulatory requirements related to wills, inheritance, and digital assets.

### Technical Requirements

1. Blockchain Platform
   - Selection of a suitable blockchain platform (e.g., Ethereum) that supports smart contracts and has a robust ecosystem.

2. Smart Contracts
   - Development of smart contracts in Solidity (for Ethereum) or an equivalent language for the chosen blockchain.
   - Mechanisms for updating smart contracts as legal and technical requirements evolve.

3. Web Development
   - Front-end developed with React.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
   - Back-end services using Node.js and Express.js for API development, user management, and interaction with the blockchain.

4. Database Management
   - Use of MongoDB for storing user profiles and non-blockchain transactional data.
   - Consideration of Cassandra for distributed data management, if necessary for scalability.

5. Integration
   - Integration with Web3.js or Ethers.js for blockchain interactions.
   - Secure API endpoints for external data verification (e.g., death records).

6. Testing
   - Comprehensive testing strategy including unit tests, integration tests, and smart contract audits.

7. Deployment
   - Strategy for deploying the web application and smart contracts, considering aspects like gas costs and blockchain network selection.

Defining these requirements forms the blueprint for the project and guides all stages of development, from initial design to deployment and maintenance.
